# There are no tricks, just pure logic, so good luck and don't give up.
#
# 1. In a there are four rooms, four people and four subjects.
# 2. In each room only one person teaches exactly one subject
#
# THE QUESTION: Who teaches where and what?
#
# HINTS
#
# 1. Mr. Maier never teaches in room 4.
# 2. Mr. M端ller teaches German.
# 3. Mr. Schmid and Mr. M端ller dont teach in neighbouring rooms.
# 4. Mrs. Huber teaches Math.
# 5. Physics always gets thaught in room 4.
# 6. German and English dont get thaught in room 1.
#

# how do you define a constraint?
# does it has to be in a normalform?
